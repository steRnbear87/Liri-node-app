# **LIRI** --- Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface

LIRI is similar to Apple's SIRI, but it is run on the command line. This is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives back data. In this app, LIRI has been given 4 commands.

* 'concert-this'
* 'spotify-this-song'
* 'movie-this'
* 'do-what-it-says'

The following screenshots will show how the commands work.

This is what it looks like when LIRI is asked to 'concert-this'.

The following image is of LIRI's command 'spotify-this-song'.

The next image is of the command 'movie-this'.

The last image is the 'do-what-it-says' command. This is where LIRI takes the text of a random file and uses it to call one of LIRI's commands.
